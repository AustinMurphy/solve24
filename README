Solve24  takes 4 positive integers,
and attempts to create an equation that equals 24, 
using all 4 numbers plus any combination of the 4 operators +, -, *, /.


Example:

$ ./solve24.py 7 5 3 3 
(((5*3)-7)*3) = 24.0


For the purpose of finding only unique solutions, 
solve24 considers:
  (a+b) == (b+a) 
  (a*b) == (b*a)
and reports only the unique version where a>=b.
